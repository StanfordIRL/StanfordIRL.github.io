Since our conversation was cut short the other day at Philz, Chris and I followed up for dinner. After Stanford, he joined Google X for over a year, working on a project which later became the high-profile, scifi-like, immortality-seeking Verily. While at Google, he casually authored two patents:

- [Patent WO2017099930A1 - A method for improving heart rate estimates by combining multiple measurement modalities](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2017099930A1)
- [Patent US20170220752 - Systems and methods for probabilistic pulse rate estimation from photoplethysmographic measurements in the presence of nonstationary and nontrivial signal and noise spectra](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20170220752)

After that, he spent the next 2 years working at his own startup, Midori, which provides voice search for e-commerce companies and which, sadly, doesn’t exist anymore. Then he was an entrepreneur in residence at Khosla for 2 years, and now he’s partnering with a doctor in Seattle to start a stealthy startup to use voice recognition technologies to make healthcare more efficient.

Chris seems to have an overwhelming desire to share his wisdom, evidenced in his recent blog posts and his detailed answers to every question, so I asked him for advice.

“Don’t try to network for the sake of networking. Create values and people will come to you.”<br>
“That sounds reasonable enough.”<br>
“And you should write to Jensen Huang,” he said.<br>
“Why?”<br>
“There’s no downside to it. The worst thing that can happen is that he’ll notice you. You only have a very short window to do that -- write to him during your first month at NVIDIA.”
