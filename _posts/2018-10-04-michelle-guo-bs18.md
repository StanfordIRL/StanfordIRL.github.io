Just want to give a shout-out to my girl Michelle for being featured in [BEST OF ECCV2018 on Computer Vision News](https://www.rsipvision.com/ComputerVisionNews-2018October/16/), for her work on fewshot action recognition in 3D. We met in Scotland during a short study abroad program. Now she’s doing a co-term. She doesn’t know if she’s going to do a PhD yet. “Let’s start with a master and see how it goes.”

She just finished her undergrad and always has 70+ citations! See [her Google Scholar’s profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lyjjpNMAAAAJ&hl=en).
