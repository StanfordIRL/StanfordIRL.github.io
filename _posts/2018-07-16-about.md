This is a chronicle of the lives of my former classmates and the amazing things they do after Stanford. Your daily dose of existential crisis. You're welcome.

When reading about someone I admire, I often wonder what they did to get where they are -- so that I can learn from them. I have no doubt that some of my classmates will become successful one day, and I hope that this blog will provide a window into their drive and their struggle.

You can sign up for the monthly newsletter to get the most interesting updates about what people are up to after Stanford [here](https://huyenchip.us17.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=0aecf69b8c2457096b32fa306&id=b9aeb35f8c) or in the box below.
