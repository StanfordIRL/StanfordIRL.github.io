	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>It’s been a year of many first’s for Vu. She got married. Elsa, her first startup, closed its series A of $7M led by Gradient Ventures, Google’s AI fund. Her husband started his own company. Her baby is due in 5 weeks.</p>

<p>“Since he’s my first child, the doctor said he could come out any day now, starting next week.”</p>

<p>“How are you going to fit a baby in your schedule?”</p>

<p>“Ugh, I really don’t know,” Vu laughed. “After we got married, my husband told me my startup experiences inspired him to start his own. And I was like: ‘Why not? It’s not like we have children to worry about.’ Then two months later, I got pregnant.”</p>

<p>In an article on Elsa, Wired wrote: [“in every other way, Van doesn’t fit the American startup mold.”(https://www.wired.com/2017/03/googles-plan-to-engineer-the-next-silicon-valleys/) For one thing, Vu is a woman. Against the backdrop of legions of male startup founders walking around in hoodies, loose jeans, and questionable footwear choices, Vu stands out with long dark hair, flowing dresses, and French manicure. 2018 set the all-time high record for investments in startups with at least one female co-founder, yet <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/2018-sets-all-time-high-for-investment-dollars-into-female-founded-startups/">they only accounted for 17% of venture dollars funded globally</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="Akash Modi" src="https://stanfordirl.com//assets/images/people/vu-van.jpg" style="float: center; max-width: 80%; margin: 0 0 1em 0.5em" /></p>

<p>Second, Vu has never coded a day in her life. She went to a college in Vietnam, majored in International Business and Economics. She worked as a trainee at the logistics giant Maersk for two years before moving to Denmark to be the CEO’s special assistant. “Not being technical is an advantage,” Vu told me. “Since I don’t know what’s possible, I’m free to develop my ideas without any technical constraints. It makes me more creative.”</p>

<p>Having met my fair share of Silicon Valley high-achievers, I’ve always subsciously expected someone to blurt out mid-conversation: “I’m not here to make friends. I’m here to change the world.” But Vu is oddly, and refreshingly, personable. She has a warm smile, speaks kind words, and isn’t afraid to be vulnerable. “You aren’t friends until you can be vulnerable around each other,” Vu said.</p>

<p>Because of her willingness to be vulnerable, Vu has been able to develop close friendships even in places lesser-known for friendships: business schools. She met her best friend at the GSB, who is now her product manager. “The first quarter was tough. None of my classmates has heard of the name of the college I went to or the company I worked for. They were like: what does a logistics company even do? You know the feeling of being an admission mistake. I felt like everyone around was better than me. The first test was to get an internship. The kind of people who get into the GSB are those who turn down job offers, not those who have to compete for an internship. So when we applied and didn’t even get a response, we were so disheartened. I couldn’t talk to anyone because I was afraid they’d look down on me even more. One evening, I was in the dorm with two classmates when this girl burst in crying. She was scared that she wouldn’t get any internship. None of the companies she applied gave her an interview. That’s when I realized that I wasn’t alone and one by one, we started opening up. We are all great friends now.”</p>

<p>In Bay Area, everyone is really good at putting on a show of their successes. People talk about the money they’ve raised, the offers they’ve turned down, the shiny brands they’re associated with. I have a lot of acquaintances but never feel like I have enough friends who I can share my struggles with. I always feel like an outsider: not doing enough, not knowing enough, not having enough going on.</p>

<p>“The GSB did a really good job of breaking down that barrier,” Vu said. “My favorite class is touchy feely. It’s not the official name but that’s how everyone calls it. We were divided into groups of 12 each and met twice a week, each time for 3 hours. Everything was confidential – we weren’t even allowed to tell people who else was in our group. We could talk about any topic. Some people used the time to get help with relationship problems. The toughest guys broke into tears. It was very emotional. We all became really good friends after that.”</p>

<p>Vu’s drive to be the best is, however, very Silicon Valley. Her mom moved to the US when she was 16 but Vu chose to stay in Vietnam because: “I was going to a prestigious high school. If I went to the US, I’d have to start over at a mediocre one.” In college, she graduated valedictorian of her class and got into business schools at both Harvard and Stanford. While doing her MBA, she found time to pick up a master in education.</p>

<p>“Like everyone in my MBA class, I was very unhappy the first year out of school. We were taught to believe that we’d change the world, but here I was at my consulting job, clearly not changing anything. Then I stumbled upon this problem that I wanted to solve. I wanted to create an app to help people reduce their accents when speaking English. I wasn’t technical so I knew that I needed a co-founder. I talked to people, one person introduced me to the next, and I met Xavier [Xavier Anguera Vu’s co-founder and Elsa’s CTO] at a conference.”</p>

<p>Vu is grateful for her co-founder and highly recommends anyone interested in doing startup to find at least a co-founder. “In the beginning, you won’t be able to hire anyone good. Nobody will be dedicated to your company unless that person is your co-founder. With a co-founder, you can move three times faster. And in the startup world, speed is everything.”</p>

<p>Founded in 2015, Elsa’s rise hasn’t exactly been meteoric, but steady with tremendous momentum. Vu refuses to follow the Silicon Valley’s traditional growth hacking model: putting a large chunk of capital into ads to acquire new users. Elsa doesn’t even have budget for marketing and PR. The traction they have had so far comes entirely from word of mouth.</p>

<p>Elsa got its first break when the team won the first place at South by Southwest education competition. “After SXSW announced the winner, 30,000 new users signed up and all our servers crashed. Luckily, we pulled through.” In June 2016, it became the best educational app on Product Hunt. In 2017, it went viral as Salma Hayek admitted on <em>The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon</em> that because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pghn5HfX5IU">her husband was talking on the phone every night with Elsa, she thought that he was having an affair</a>. By the end of 2017, Elsa hit 1 million downloads on Google Play alone. Elsa now has 4 million users from 101 countries.</p>

<p>Her team has grown to consist of almost 30 people, divided among three offices in San Francisco, Lisbon, and Ho Chi Minh City. “Our CTO is in Portugal so our main engineering team is there. The office in Ho Chi Minh takes care of some engineering aspects and customer services. SF is where our product team is. With engineering, the rest of the world has been very fast in catching up with Silicon Valley and the cost is like one third of the cost here. For product, you still have to come back to the Bay for talents. My PM has 15 years of experience doing different products. Product management wasn’t even a thing in Vietnam 15 years ago.”</p>

<p>With her team scattering around the globe, Vu spends half her time traveling. It took me six months to get on her schedule. “It’s not easy. You can’t do it unless you have an understanding spouse.”</p>

<p>And Vu has one whom she met five years ago. “He also went to Stanford. Actually, he spent a lot of time at Stanford.” Her husband did his undergrad, master’s, PhD, and then postdoc at the same school.</p>

<p>Since Vu seemed to be able to achieve that mysterious “a successful career and a happy home”, I felt like I needed to ask her about her dating experiences.</p>

<p>“We were lucky that we met each other at the right time. A couple of years earlier, my friend worked out this formula that she’d have to date 46 people to meet the right one, so we both strategized on how to reach that number with the limited amount of time that we had. I was doing consulting work so I had to travel a lot and could only meet people on the weekends. Sometimes I’d schedule 30-minute coffee dates back to back. If someone seemed potential, I’d stretch the date further. After a few months, I gave up because I realized that I needed some me time. I met my husband at the end of my consulting career when I finally had time for relationships.”</p>

<p>“What criteria were you looking for?”</p>

<p>“My criteria change over time. As I grew older, I realize that a lot of things I thought were important actually aren’t. The most important criterion for me is whether that person makes me more or less stressed when I’m home. Can I be myself around that person? My work is so stressful I can’t be with someone who gives me more stress.”</p>

<p>Maybe because we’re both small women who were raised in Vietnam but somehow ended up the Bay Area, I understand what she has been through. A friend told me that when he met her 15 years ago in Vietnam, her aspiration was to become a receptionist somewhere nice, and look where she is now. As Vu turned away to leave, I felt a strange sense of calmness. I need more people like Vu in my life. Silicon Valley needs more Vu’s.</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>Having an hour between meetings in SF, I was trying to think of what to do when I thought of John Luttig, an associate at Founders Fund. John and I knew each from section leading but weren’t close. I remembered seeing his face on a door poster when he was running for the student senate and thought: “I’d never be as ‘out there’ as this guy.” Over the years, I occasionally hit him up for advice and he was always accommodating. When I messaged him to meet up, he gave me a list of neighborhoods he’d be in depending on the time of the day.</p>

<p>“Oh and disclaimer we’re not hiring,” added John at the end of his message.</p>

<p>We met at 5pm at a coffee shop and John was fresh out of his shower. It wasn’t that he ended his workday early. It’s just that there isn’t a clear work/life separation for VCs: he hangs out with people he hopes to bring him deals one day and his friends are sometimes in his portfolio.</p>

<p>“How would you describe your friend circle?” asked I.<br />
“Some are from the fund, some are founders, my girlfriend, some from the Thiel Fellowship.”<br />
“Not many people from Stanford?”<br />
“Some. Part of my job is to keep tab on Stanford grads, particularly those considering starting companies or looking for a new interesting gig.”<br />
“How do you define an ‘interesting gig?”<br />
“Any job that you can’t apply for.”<br /></p>

<p>I asked him about the PS he added at the end of his message.</p>

<p>“Are there a lot of Stanford people asking you for jobs?”<br />
“A decent amount. I’m sorry, did I offend you? I just thought I should be upfront.”<br />
“Not at all. I found it funny. Nobody has given me that disclaimer before. Most people did the opposite thing. They wanted to hang out then tried to recruit me.”<br />
“You wouldn’t like being a VC anyway.” [I rolled my eyes. VCs always say that.]</p>

<p>“Do you live up to the VC stereotype?”<br />
“Well, I do own a pair of Allbirds but I try not to wear them that much. I definitely don’t wear those VC vests. I think some people don’t like VCs because they think we’re transactional. It’s our job to constantly evaluate potential deals. But I try not to do that when I’m with my friends.”<br />
“Do you work with Peter Thiel often?”<br />
“Founders Fund’s office is small so I see him around.”<br />
“He’s a controversial figure.”<br />
“I think he’s incredibly thoughtful and helpful. He is the reason I’m where I am today.”<br />
“How so?”<br />
“I was the editor in chief of the Stanford Review. It was founded by Peter Thiel. That’s how I got to know him. I interned with the Thiel Fellowship before.”<br />
“Are you happy with where you are?”<br />
“Yes. I’ve been incredibly lucky.”<br /></p>

<p>I walked him back to his place, a fancy-looking apartment in Pac Heights. He was about to pick up his girlfriend since college, <a href="https://stanfordirl.com/tag/melisa-tokmak/">Melisa Tokmak (B.S. ‘17)</a>, who is a product manager at Facebook. He’s happy with his work and with his relationship. He runs a <a href="https://us19.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=08307b0615c07686e2049c8ea&amp;id=2b5966acb1">weekly newsletter</a> in which he shares one thing he’s learned and one question he’s thinking about. He also hosts poker nights every Tuesday. Don’t shoot him an email if you want a job, but shoot him an email if you want to brainstorm about your career or company.</p>

<p>Books that John is reading:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A Military History of the Western World (From the Defeat of the Spanish Armada to the Battle of Waterloo) (reading Volume II rn (finished vol I))</li>
  <li>Hegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit</li>
</ul>

<p>Three people John would like to be featured next on StanfordIRL:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://stanfordirl.com/tag/chris-sauer/">Chris Sauer</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://stanfordirl.com/tag/akshay-rampuria/">Akshay Rampuria</a></li>

	     <p>You can always tell how much money your startup friend has just raised by how fast they disappear from your circle.</p>

<p>Simon was my student the first time I taught the course <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs20si/">TensorFlow for Deep Learning Research</a> in early 2017. He was a first year PhD candidate back then and I was so impressed by his resume: he was an NDSEG fellow, an NSF fellow, a James R. Swartz Entrepreneurial fellow, etc. and his robotics work has been featured on every fancy website. Check out <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~kalouche/index.html">his website</a> and be ready to question your self-worth.</p>

<p><img alt="Simon Kalouche" src="https://stanfordirl.com//assets/images/people/simon-kalouche.jpg" style="float: center; max-width: 80%; margin: 0 0 1em 0.5em" /></p>

<p>We became friends when we were invited by the same VC to a startup launch party and we bonded over the long drive and our mutual fascination for how strange the startup world was. We became even better friends when I saw Instagram stories of him partying like it’s 1999 in Cabo.</p>

<p>Soon after my class, he took leave from his PhD program and moved to the city to work on his startup. I’ve been meaning to visit his office for a long time but I was lazy and it was getting increasingly difficult to schedule time with him. Until one day, I decided to drag my lazy ass to the city to visit Simon’s startup and a bunch of other companies.</p>

<p>His startup is located in a cozy space near Powell Station. About a quarter of the space is dedicated to robot arms. <a href="https://nimble.ai/">Nimble.ai</a>, his startup, uses human teleoperation through AR/VR interfaces to teach robots complex skills like how to grasp and manipulate any kind of object. Their first product is a robot for eCommerce fulfillment that may one day handle your Amazon orders. He let me control the robot arm through a graphical interface and after a series of my deliberate efforts to sabotage his algorithm, Simon decided that I was the worst human operator. “You’d never be able to get a job sorting items at a warehouse.”</p>

<p>Simon used to be down to party but ever since his startup, ‘party’ suddenly became a curse word. He just works all the time. He spent all September and October fund-raising and he just got his term sheet.</p>

<p>“I used to think that building a company means that I just need to have amazing technologies, but now I spend the majority of my time dealing with other stuff: raising funds, hiring, managing, motivating people, finding customers, etc. I’m learning so much. I’m not even trying to network. I just talk to people about what I’m working on and somehow that leads to new relationships.”<br /></p>

<p>We walked around his block and I got the impression that if I ever did a startup, I would want a co-founder like Simon. He’s extremely smart, hard-working, charismatic, and fun to talk to.</p>

<p>“What can I help you with?” I asked.<br />
“At this point, the most important thing is hiring. We’re planning on hiring 15 more engineers in the coming months. Computer Vision, yes. If you know anyone, let me know.”</p>

<p>They are looking for really good engineers. “We recently went to career fairs at Berkeley, MIT and Stanford and got 300+ resumes. I’ve been spending so much time screening resumes that I’ve become a snob. They have to stand out.”</p>

<p>So if you’re amazing engineers/researchers in Computer Vision looking for an exciting, early-stage startup to join, check out Nimble.ai. 10/10 would recommend.</p>

<p>===</p>

<p>Thanks to the suggestions from <a href="https://stanfordirl.com/tag/lucio-dery/">Lucio</a> and Simon, we’re asking everyone about the books they are reading and the people they want to be featured next.</p>

<p>Books Simon is reading:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days (Jake Knapp, John Zeratsky, Braden Kowitz, 2016)</li>
  <li>Inspired: How To Create Products Customers Love (Marty Cagan, 2018)</li>
  <li>Hire With Your Head: Using Performance-Based Hiring to Build Great Teams (Lou Adler, 2002)</li>
</ul>

<p>Simon: “Sprint and Inspired are about product and solving problems around customer need fast. Hire with your head is about … hiring. This book was recommended to me by Kian Katanforoosh (M.S. ‘17).</p>

<p>3 people that Simon wants to be featured next:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://stanfordirl.com/tag/kian-katanforoosh/">Kian Katanforoosh</a> (M.S. ‘17)</li>
  <li><a href="https://stanfordirl.com/tag/zayd-enam/">Zayd Enam</a> (Ph.D. ‘22 - on leave)</li>
  <li><a href="https://stanfordirl.com/tag/andre-esteva/">Andre Esteva</a> (Ph.D. ‘18)</li>
</ul>

<p>P.S. Simon is tryna grow his Twitter so find him <a href="https://twitter.com/simonkalouche">@simonkalouche</a></p>

	     <p>Lucio likes telling the story when we first met. He was complaining (more like humble-bragging) about the pressure he felt because so many kids in Ghana looked up to him and I shot him down like fireworks.</p>

<p>“There are 2000 people following me on Facebook,” he said.<br />
“I have 80,000,” I said.</p>

<p>We worked together on an automatic essay grading project that he carried me through. Lucio majored in Physics (brain alert) but had an amazing grasp of math and programming. By the end of his coterm, he had an offer to join Facebook AI Research (FAIR) in Paris - a position that he really wanted.</p>

<p>So I was surprised when he texted me he was in Bay Area. Instead of joining FAIR in Paris, he joined the new FAIR office in Seattle.</p>

<p>“Why would anyone choose Seattle over Paris?”<br />
“I was going through a lot of personal stuff and didn’t want to deal with it in a new country. Yeah, don’t worry, I’m fine now.”</p>

<p>Indeed he looked fine. He had finally decided to embrace his hipsterness and proudly wore his gray, big-lense hipster glasses. He also works out everyday. Even though he’s still trying to navigate his new job (it took him a long time to settle on what project to work on – which is language modeling on Wikipedia), he enjoys living in Seattle.</p>

<p><img alt="Lucio Dery" src="https://stanfordirl.com//assets/images/people/lucio-dery.jpg" style="float: center; max-width: 80%; margin: 0 0 1em 2em" /></p>

<p>Reasons why he loves Seattle:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A girl hit on him for the first time ever. “That would never happen in Bay Area,” said Lucio.</li>
  <li>It’s good to get out of the Stanford bubble (but he still lives with a bunch of friends from college).</li>
  <li>Housing is so cheap. They have an actual guest room.</li>
  <li>Tax is so low. [Lucio: “I don’t even know what to do with all the money I have now.” Me: “Have you heard of something called cryptocurrency?”]</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite his love for Seattle, he still visits Bay Area every month for work. Next September, he will be starting his Ph.D. at CMU. He’s progressively moving to areas with worse weather. Wish him luck.</p>
