	     <p>Having an hour between meetings in SF, I was trying to think of what to do when I thought of John Luttig, an associate at Founders Fund. John and I knew each from section leading but weren’t close. I remembered seeing his face on a door poster when he was running for the student senate and thought: “I’d never be as ‘out there’ as this guy.” Over the years, I occasionally hit him up for advice and he was always accommodating. When I messaged him to meet up, he gave me a list of neighborhoods he’d be in depending on the time of the day.</p>

<p>“Oh and disclaimer we’re not hiring,” added John at the end of his message.</p>

<p>We met at 5pm at a coffee shop and John was fresh out of his shower. It wasn’t that he ended his workday early. It’s just that there isn’t a clear work/life separation for VCs: he hangs out with people he hopes to bring him deals one day and his friends are sometimes in his portfolio.</p>

<p>“How would you describe your friend circle?” asked I.<br />
“Some are from the fund, some are founders, my girlfriend, some from the Thiel Fellowship.”<br />
“Not many people from Stanford?”<br />
“Some. Part of my job is to keep tab on Stanford grads, particularly those considering starting companies or looking for a new interesting gig.”<br />
“How do you define an ‘interesting gig?”<br />
“Any job that you can’t apply for.”<br /></p>

<p>I asked him about the PS he added at the end of his message.</p>

<p>“Are there a lot of Stanford people asking you for jobs?”<br />
“A decent amount. I’m sorry, did I offend you? I just thought I should be upfront.”<br />
“Not at all. I found it funny. Nobody has given me that disclaimer before. Most people did the opposite thing. They wanted to hang out then tried to recruit me.”<br />
“You wouldn’t like being a VC anyway.” [I rolled my eyes. VCs always say that.]</p>

<p>“Do you live up to the VC stereotype?”<br />
“Well, I do own a pair of Allbirds but I try not to wear them that much. I definitely don’t wear those VC vests. I think some people don’t like VCs because they think we’re transactional. It’s our job to constantly evaluate potential deals. But I try not to do that when I’m with my friends.”<br />
“Do you work with Peter Thiel often?”<br />
“Founders Fund’s office is small so I see him around.”<br />
“He’s a controversial figure.”<br />
“I think he’s incredibly thoughtful and helpful. He is the reason I’m where I am today.”<br />
“How so?”<br />
“I was the editor in chief of the Stanford Review. It was founded by Peter Thiel. That’s how I got to know him. I interned with the Thiel Fellowship before.”<br />
“Are you happy with where you are?”<br />
“Yes. I’ve been incredibly lucky.”<br /></p>

<p>I walked him back to his place, a fancy-looking apartment in Pac Heights. He was about to pick up his girlfriend since college, <a href="https://stanfordirl.com/tag/melisa-tokmak/">Melisa Tokmak (B.S. ‘17)</a>, who is a product manager at Facebook. He’s happy with his work and with his relationship. He runs a <a href="https://us19.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=08307b0615c07686e2049c8ea&amp;id=2b5966acb1">weekly newsletter</a> in which he shares one thing he’s learned and one question he’s thinking about. He also hosts poker nights every Tuesday. Don’t shoot him an email if you want a job, but shoot him an email if you want to brainstorm about your career or company.</p>

<p>Books that John is reading:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A Military History of the Western World (From the Defeat of the Spanish Armada to the Battle of Waterloo) (reading Volume II rn (finished vol I))</li>
  <li>Hegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit</li>
</ul>

<p>Three people John would like to be featured next on StanfordIRL:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://stanfordirl.com/tag/chris-sauer/">Chris Sauer</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://stanfordirl.com/tag/akshay-rampuria/">Akshay Rampuria</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://stanfordirl.com/tag/grant-sanderson/">Grant Sanderson</a></li>
</ul>
