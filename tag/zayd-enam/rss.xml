	     <p>You can always tell how much money your startup friend has just raised by how fast they disappear from your circle.</p>

<p>Simon was my student the first time I taught the course <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs20si/">TensorFlow for Deep Learning Research</a> in early 2017. He was a first year PhD candidate back then and I was so impressed by his resume: he was an NDSEG fellow, an NSF fellow, a James R. Swartz Entrepreneurial fellow, etc. and his robotics work has been featured on every fancy website. Check out <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~kalouche/index.html">his website</a> and be ready to question your self-worth.</p>

<p>We became friends when we were invited by the same VC to a startup launch party and we bonded over the long drive and our mutual fascination for how strange the startup world was. We became even better friends when I saw Instagram stories of him partying like it’s 1999 in Cabo.</p>

<p>Soon after my class, he took leave from his PhD program and moved to the city to work on his startup. I’ve been meaning to visit his office for a long time but I was lazy and it was getting increasingly difficult to schedule time with him. Until one day, I decided to drag my lazy ass to the city to visit Simon’s startup and a bunch of other companies.</p>

<p>His startup is located in a cozy space near Powell Station. About a quarter of the space is dedicated to robot arms. <a href="https://nimble.ai/">Nimble.ai</a>, his startup, uses human teleoperation through AR/VR interfaces to teach robots complex skills like how to grasp and manipulate any kind of object. Their first product is a robot for eCommerce fulfillment that may one day handle your Amazon orders. He let me control the robot arm through a graphical interface and after a series of my deliberate efforts to sabotage his algorithm, Simon decided that I was the worst human operator. “You’d never be able to get a job sorting items at a warehouse.”</p>

<p>Simon used to be down to party but ever since his startup, ‘party’ suddenly became a curse word. He just works all the time. He spent all September and October fund-raising and he just got his term sheet.</p>

<p>“I used to think that building a company means that I just need to have amazing technologies, but now I spend the majority of my time dealing with other stuff: raising funds, hiring, managing, motivating people, finding customers, etc. I’m learning so much. I’m not even trying to network. I just talk to people about what I’m working on and somehow that leads to new relationships.”<br /></p>

<p>We walked around his block and I got the impression that if I ever did a startup, I would want a co-founder like Simon. He’s extremely smart, hard-working, charismatic, and fun to talk to.</p>

<p>“What can I help you with?” I asked.<br />
“At this point, the most important thing is hiring. We’re planning on hiring 15 more engineers in the coming months. Computer Vision, yes. If you know anyone, let me know.”</p>

<p>They are looking for really good engineers. “We recently went to career fairs at Berkeley, MIT and Stanford and got 300+ resumes. I’ve been spending so much time screening resumes that I’ve become a snob. They have to stand out.”</p>

<p>So if you’re amazing engineers/researchers in Computer Vision looking for an exciting, early-stage startup to join, check out Nimble.ai. 10/10 would recommend.</p>

<p>===</p>

<p>Thanks to the suggestions from <a href="https://stanfordirl.com/tag/lucio-dery/">Lucio</a> and Simon, we’re asking everyone about the books they are reading and the people they want to be featured next.</p>

<p>Books Simon is reading:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days (Jake Knapp, John Zeratsky, Braden Kowitz, 2016)</li>
  <li>Inspired: How To Create Products Customers Love (Marty Cagan, 2018)</li>
  <li>Hire With Your Head: Using Performance-Based Hiring to Build Great Teams (Lou Adler, 2002)</li>
</ul>

<p>Simon: “Sprint and Inspired are about product and solving problems around customer need fast. Hire with your head is about … hiring. This book was recommended to me by Kian Katanforoosh (M.S. ‘17).</p>

<p>3 people that Simon wants to be featured next:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://stanfordirl.com/tag/kian-katanforoosh/">Kian Katanforoosh</a> (M.S. ‘17)</li>
