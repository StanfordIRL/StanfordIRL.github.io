	     <p>This is a chronicle of the lives of my former classmates and the amazing things they do after Stanford. Your daily dose of existential crisis. You’re welcome.</p>

<p>When reading about someone I admire, I often wonder what they did to get where they are – so that I can learn from them. I have no doubt that some of my classmates will become successful one day, and I hope that this blog will provide a window into their drive and their struggle.</p>

<p>You can sign up for the monthly newsletter to get the most interesting updates about what people are up to after Stanford <a href="https://huyenchip.us17.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=0aecf69b8c2457096b32fa306&amp;id=b9aeb35f8c">here</a> or in the box below.</p>

<p>If you’d like me to feature you or someone you know, shoot me an email, which you can find on my website <a href="https://huyenchip.com">huyenchip.com</a>.</p>
