## StanfordIRL (Stanford In Real Life)

Website: https://stanfordirl.github.io

This is a chronicle of the lives of my former classmates and the amazing things they do after Stanford. Your daily dose of existential crisis. You're welcome.

My Stanford circle biases heavily towards those in tech. Some of them will undoubtedly become rich and famous one day. You read about them here first.
